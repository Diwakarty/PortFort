# PortFort: Vulnerability Scanner & Report Generator with Mitigation Steps

## 📌 What is this project?

This project is an **enhanced port scanner** that scans a target system for open ports and provides a detailed **security assessment**. It generates **human-readable reports** in HTML and PDF formats, including mitigation steps for detected vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Why did I create this?

I created this tool because existing port scanners lack key features that improve security assessments. This scanner provides:

- **Automated report generation** for easy analysis.
- **Mitigation steps** for detected vulnerabilities.
- **Explanations of open ports**, detailing their function and potential security risks.

This tool is designed to help **penetration testers, security professionals, and system administrators** better understand and secure their networks.

  - **HTML format** 🌐
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays results in a structured and easy-to-understand way.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.
